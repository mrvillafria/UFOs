# UFOs

## Overview of Project
For this week's project, we will be using the coding language JavaScript. JavaScript is typically known as a front-end development language and has several uses specific to data visualizations. We will add JavaScript into an HTML page to display our data through a dynamic webpage. A dynamic webpage allows user inputs and updates based on the interactions. On our webpage, our main feature will be a table that will allow the users to refine their search through filters. CSS and Bootstrap will also be used to build and style the webpage.
