# UFOs

## Overview of Project
For this week's project, we will be using the coding language JavaScript. JavaScript is typically known as a front-end development language and has several uses specific to data visualizations. We will add JavaScript into an HTML page to display our data through a dynamic webpage. A dynamic webpage allows user inputs and updates based on the interactions. On our webpage, our main feature will be a table that will allow the users to refine their search through filters. CSS and Bootstrap will also be used to build and style the webpage.

### Purpose
The purpose of this week's project was to help Dana, a data journalist, post her UFO findings to a webpage. This dynamic webpage includes Dana's article and a table to display UFO sighting information such as date, city, country, shape, duration, and comments. The information used to populate the table was pulled from a JavaScript file. Because there was so much information, we also created filters to fine tune the results.

## Results

#### Instructions
On our dynamic webpage, the users can search and filter the UFO sightings table based on date, city, state, country, and shape.

There is a "Filter Search" feature on the left-hand side of the page with the different search criteria.

Please notice in each input box, it displays an example, or a placeholder, for each filter option. This will help show the user the input format for what they want to search on.
